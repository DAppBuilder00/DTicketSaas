Perfect 👍 I’ll turn that documentation into a **proper `README.md` file** that you can drop directly into GitHub, or attach in your CodePen project details.

Here’s the full markdown:

## 🎟️ Tickets

Tickets are stored in `script.js` as an array of objects:

```js
{
  subject: "Website Issue",
  customer: "John Doe",
  status: "Open",       // Open | Pending | Closed
  priority: "High",     // High | Medium | Low
  tags: ["Bug", "Urgent"],
  due: "2025-08-25",
  updated: "2025-08-20"
}
````

* **Status**:

  * 🟢 Open
  * 🟠 Pending
  * 🔴 Closed
* **Priority**:

  * 🔴 High
  * 🟡 Medium
  * 🔵 Low

Badges are styled using CSS classes.

---

## 📌 Pipelines

* Kanban board with **drag-and-drop tickets**
* Columns: **Open, In Progress, Closed**
* Moving a card updates the status in memory

---

## 🌙 Theme Toggle

* Switch between **Light/Dark mode**
* Saves preference in `localStorage`

---

## 🛠️ Customization

* Add new ticket fields → modify ticket object in `script.js`
* Change sidebar items → edit `<nav>` in `index.html`
* Update theme colors → edit CSS variables in `:root` of `styles.css`
* Replace analytics with live charts → integrate `Chart.js` or similar

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

* Tickets are **in-memory only** (refresh resets data)
* No authentication/login
* Analytics are placeholders

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Connect to a **database or API**
* Add **ticket search & filtering**
* Add **authentication**
* Enable **email notifications**

---

## 📖 How to Run

1. Open `index.html` in a browser or drop the files into CodePen
2. Navigate using the sidebar
3. Add/manage tickets from **Tickets**
4. Drag & drop tickets in **Pipelines**
5. Switch theme using **Toggle Theme**

💡 Built for learning and prototyping SaaS dashboard concepts.

Would you like me to also include **setup instructions for GitHub Pages deployment** (so your SaaS dashboard can go live with a free URL)?
